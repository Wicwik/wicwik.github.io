## This blog
I draw a **lot of** inspiration from [152334h blog](https://152334h.github.io), but mostly because I like the theme and because it is so simple to setup/update. All cudos goes to 152334h, thanks!

You can find all source codes for this blog at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Wicwik/wicwik.github.io).
