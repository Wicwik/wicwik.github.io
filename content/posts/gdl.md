## Introduction

Last week, I have attended the [Easter European Machine Learning Summer School](https://www.eeml.eu/) in Novi Sad (Serbia), and I had a blast! One lecture that I was looking forward to was about Geometric Deep Learning by Michael Bronstein. I heard about graph neural networks, but never been able to get a deeper look on how it actually works.

In this blog post, I will go trough on what is Geometric Deep learning and how to easily setup a grap neural network. Since I am an NLP guy, I will steer my attention (pun intended) to [Graph Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903) by Petar Veličković, et.al who was also at the summer school.

I will draw the knowledge mostly from the [Geometric Deep Learning Grids, Groups, Graphs, Geodesics, and Gauges book](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.13478) by Bronstein, et.al.

First, lets got to the basics of Graphs and Supervised Deep Learning :eyeglasses:
